	<title>Combinatorics and Counting Problems</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>If we pose the question, <q>How may ways can we flip three coins?</q> we can simply list all of the possibilities by exhaustion.  In fact, there are eight:
        	<me>\{ HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT \}.</me>
        However, the problem is far more difficult if we ask how many ways are there to flip 1000 coins.  In fact, there are <m>2^{1000}</m> ways. Since <m>2^{1000}</m> is a 302 digit number, it really isn't feasible to list all of the possibilities.  We need to be a lot more clever.  In order to compute probabilities of equally likely events in a sample space, we need to learn how to count things.</p>

        <p>An order or arrangement of people or objects is called a <term>permutation</term>.</p>

        <example>
        	<p>Suppose that we with to elect two officers, a president and a vice-president, from 10 members of a club.  The club members will first elect a president from the 10 club members and will then choose a vice-president from the remaining 9 members. Using the Fundamental Principle of Counting, there are <m>10 \cdot 9 = 90</m> ways to elect a president followed by electing a vice-president.</p>
        </example>

        <p>If <m>n</m> objects are chose <m>r</m> at a time, the number of possible permutations (ordered arrangements) is 
        <me>{}_n P_r = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n - r + 1).</me></p>


        <p>The <term>factorial</term> of a positive integer <m>n</m> is defined to be
    		<me>n! = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1.</me>
    	We define <m>0! = 1</m>.</p>

    	<p>A <term>combination</term> is an arrnagement of people or objects where order is not important.</p>

    	<p>If <m>n</m> objects are chose <m>r</m> at a time, the number of possible combinations (order does not matter) is 
        <me>{}_n C_r = \frac{{}_n P_r }{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.</me></p>

        <example>
        	<p>Suppose that we with to elect a committee of 3 people, from 10 members of a club.  If we were electing officers, then the number of possible ways to select three officers is
        		<me>{}_{10} P_3 = 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8.</me>
        	We could chose a committee of 3 people and then select the officers from the committee.  If we proceed in this manner, then we know that there are exactly <m>3! = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m> ways of selecting 3 officers from a committee of 3.  Therefore,
        		<me>{}_{10} P_3 = 3! {}_{10} C_3.</me></p>
        </example>
