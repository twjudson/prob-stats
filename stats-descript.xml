					<li>Construct a stem-and-leaf plot of the data.</li>

					<li>Are there any outliers?</li>

					<li>What is the five-number summary of the data?</li>

					<li>The five-number summary of data for car thefts in Starling City over the same 20 day period is 
						<me>(\min = 30, Q_1 = 40, \text{median} = 55, Q_3 = 70, \max = 90).</me>
					Compare the number of car thefts in the two cities drawing two box-and-whisker plots.</li>

					<li>How do car thefts compare in the two cities?</li>
