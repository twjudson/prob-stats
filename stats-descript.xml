    <introduction>
        <p>The learning objectives for this chapter are:
        	<ul>
        		<li>To understand how data collection methods differ and how they affect the nature of the data set.</li>

        		<li>To understand and be able to evaluate different design studies.</li>

                <li>To understand and be able to use sampling.</li>

                <li>To understand observations and experiments.</li>

        		<li>To understand and be able to analyze data using appropriate graphs and tables.</li>

        		<li>To understand how graphs and tables of data can sometimes be misleading.</li>

        <title>Populations and Samples</title>

        <p>In statistics, we study an entire <term>population</term> by taking a subset of the population called a <term>sample</term>.  For example, we may wish to know the outcome of an election.  The population might be all likely voters.  Since it isn't practical to ask everyone how they will vote, we take a subset of likely voters and poll them.  To be useful, a sample must be carefully selected and represent the entire population.  For example, if we want to poll, all Harvard Summer School students on there experience with the 2016 Summer Session, we should probably do mre than just ask the opinion of all students enrolled in mathematics courses.  Students who are studying French or Chemistry might have an entirely different perception of their experience.</p>

        <p>A better method of finding a representative sample would be to take a <term>simple random sample</term> of size <m>n</m>.  That is, we would put the names of all of the students in a hat and then draw <m>n</m> names.  Each sample of size <n>n</n> has an equal chance of being selected as well as each student.</p>

        <p>A variation on the simple random sample is a <term>stratified random sample</term>.  For example, we might divide the population of summer school students into those studying science and mathematics, social sciences, humanities, business and economics, and the arts.  We would then take a simple random sample from each group.  This way we are assured that all groups are represented.</p>

        <p>Of course, we could get a sample simply by asking the first <m>n</m> students that we see.  A sample obtained in this manner is called a <term>convenience sample</term>.  Or we could email everyone and ask them to fill out a questionnaire.  This type of sample is called a <term>volutnary response sample</term>.</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Random Rectangles</title>

            <p>Why do we insist on random samples?  For this activity, you will see a page containing 100 rectangles of different areas.  Each rectangle is composed of small squares.  For example, a rectangle that is 4 squares wide and 3 squares wide has area 12.  The idea of this activity is to compare different methods of estimating the mean area of the 100 rectangles.<fn>This activity can be found in <em>Activity-Based Statistics</em> by R. L. Scheaffer et. al., Spring-Verlag, New York, 1996.</fn></p>

                    <li>Your instructor will show you the sheet of random rectangles for a few moments.  Make a guess as to what the mean size of a rectangle is for all 100 rectangles.</li>

                    <li>Select 5 rectangles that you think are representative of the rectangles on the page.  Compute the mean of the 5 rectangles that you selected and report your computation.</li>

                    <li>Using a random number table or a random number generator, select 5 distinct random numbers between 00 and 99.  Find the five corresponding rectangles on the sheet (use 00 for rectangle 100).  Compute the mean of these five rectangles and report your results.</li>

                    <li>How do the results in (1)<ndash />(3) compare?</li>

                    <li>Which works best<mdash />a convenience sample, a random sample, or a wild guess?  Why?</li>

        <p>We also have to worry about <term>bias</term> when we sample.  In a biased sample, everyone does not have an equal chance of being selected.  Convenience and voluntary response samples are inherently biased.  Other sources of bias are <term>undercoverage</term> where some part of the population is excluded, <term>nonresponse</term> where someone in a survey refuses to participate, and <term>response</term> where someone in the sample give false or inaccurate information.</p>

    	<exercise>
        	<statement>
        		<p>A sample of 50 people is obtained to rate <em>Frosted-Chocolate Sugar Bombs</em>, a breakfast cereal.  Tell whether each of the following is an example of undercoverage, nonresponse, or response bias.
        			<ol>
        				<li>An interviewer visits a randomly selected set of homes and asks the first 50 people who answer the door whether they eat <em>Frosted-Chocolate Sugar Bombs</em> for breakfast.</li>

        				<li>An interviewer goes to the local Whole Paycheck Food Market and observes what breakfast foods 50 shoppers select.</li>
        				
        			</ol></p>
    		</statement>

    	<exercise>
    		<statement>
    			<p>A school finds that 75<percent /> of the students in detention are boys even though only 45<percent /> of the students are boys.  Does this show that the school is biased against boys?  Tell why or why not.</p>
    		</statement>
    	</exercise>

        <p>We have two types of statistical studies<mdash />experiments and observations.  In an <term>observational study</term>, we simple observe an existing population.  For example, we may take a poll of likely voters.  In an <term>experimental study</term>, we actually do something to the sample.  For example, we might test a new drug.  For example, a researcher might treat a group of patients with a new drug and compare the result to a <term>control group</term>.  Patients in the control group would either recieve a placebo or the standard existing treatment.</p>

   		<exercise>
        	<statement>
        		<p>Tell whether each of the following is an observational study or an experiment.
        			<ol>
        				<li>A researcher randomly assigns 30 people to a statistics class using the lecture method and 30 students to an online statistics class.  Their average scores on the final exam are compared.</li>

        				<li>A researcher finds 50 people who are overweight and 50 who are not.  She compares the average number of hours they spend each week watching television.</li>

                        <li>A researcher finds 100 people who talk on their cell phones while driving and 100 people who do not.  The resercher compares the driving records for one year.</li>

        		<p>The 1918 flu pandemic (commonly referred to as the Spanish flu) was an influenza pandemic that spread to nearly every part of the world.   The Spanish flu lasted from March 1918 to June 1920.  It is estimated that anywhere from 20 to 100 million people were killed worldwide.  The data on the number of new influenza cases and the number of deaths from the epidemic in San Francisco week by week from October 5, 1918 to January 25, 1919 is given in Table<nbsp /><xref ref="table-stats-descript-flu" />.  The data is given on the last day of the week.<ol>

        			<li>We would like to compare the patterns over time of the number of new cases with the number of deaths.

        <title>Using R in Sage Cells to Plot Graphs</title>

        <p>R is an open source statisical programming language.  While R has a reputation of being difficult to learn, we can program R into Sage cells.  As before, all you have to do is evaluate the cell.  You can change the data and evaluate the cell once again to get a new plot.  If you make a mistake, just reload the web page.  <em>Before evaluating the cell, make sure to select the language to be R from the pull down menu to the right and below the cell.</em></p>

        <p>Suppose that we want to a make a stem-and-leaf plot of Ruth's homeruns.</p>

            stem(ruth)]]>
