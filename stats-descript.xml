        		<p>The 1918 flu pandemic (commonly referred to as the Spanish flu) was an influenza pandemic that spread to nearly every part of the world.   The Spanish flu lasted from March 1918 to June 1920.  It is estimated that anywhere from 20 to 100 million people were killed worldwide.  The data on the number of new influenza cases and the number of deaths from the epidemic in San Francisco week by week from October 5, 1918 to January 25, 1919 is given in Table<nbsp /><xref ref="table-stats-descript-flu" />.  The data is given on the last day of the week.<ol>

        			<li>Make a line graph of weekly new cases.  Based on your plot, describe the progress of the epidemic.</li>

        			<li>We would like to compare the patterns over time of the number of new cases with the number of deaths.  To make the new variables similar in size for easier comparison, plot the number of deaths against time for October 5 to January 25, then plot the number of cases divided by 10 on the same graph using a different color.  What do you see?  In particular, how long is the lag between the changes in the number of cases and corresponding changes in deaths?</li>
