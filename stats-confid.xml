            <ul>

                <li>To understand and be able estimate with confidence.</li>

                <li>To understand and be able to find confidence intervals for a population mean.</li>

        <example>
            <p>Anyone who has ever seen the move <em>Jaws</em> knows that great white sharks are really big and really hungry.  They are at the top of the food chain<mdash />well almost, orcas (AKA killer whales) have been known to prey on great whites.  Your friend Brian has seen Jaws 25 times as well as all of the sequels.  He claims that the average length of a great white is 20 feet.  As evidence, he tells you that a 37 ft shark was trapped in a herring weir in New Brunswick, Canada, in the 1930s. Table<nbsp /><xref ref="table-stats-confid-shark" /> gives the lengths in feet of 44 great whites.  Two questions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Is your friend Brian correct?</li>

                    <li>What is the average length of a great white?</li>

            <statement>
                <p>Is there significant evidence that your friend Brain is correct?  Or is he just going off the deep end as usual?  Assume that the population standard deviation is known and is <m>\sigma = 2.55</m> feet.<fn>Actually, we do not know <m>\sigma</m>, and it would be better to use a <m>t</m>-test.</fn></p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>What is the null hypothesis?</p>
            </hint>
        </exercise>

        <p>We would like to use statistics to obrain a realistic estimate of the average length of a great white shark from our sample of 44 sharks.  We will do this by calculating a confidence interval for the population mean.</p>

        <p>A <term>confidence interval</term> for a parameter such as a mean or a population proportion has two parts.
    		<ul>
    			<li>An interval calculated from that data that has the form
    				<me>\text{estimate} \pm \text{margin of error}</me></li>

    				<li>A <term>confidence level</term> <m>C</m> that gives the probability that the interval will capture the value of the true parameter with repeated sampling.</li>
    			</ul></p>


		<p>Suppose that we choose a simple random sample of size <m>n</m> from a population where we know the standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> and we wish to estimate the mean <m>\mu</m>.  A level <m>C</m> confidence interval for <m>\mu</m> is
			<me>\overline{x} \pm z^* \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.</me>
		The value of <m>z^*</m> is given in Table<nbsp /><xref ref="table-stats-confid-z-star" />.</p>

                    <li>Calculate the mean.  <m>\overline{x} = 15.59</m>.</li>

        <title>Confidence Intervals for Population Proportions</title>

        <p>Confidence intervals for proportions work much the same way as confidence intervals for means except that we replace the standard deviation with the <term>standard error</term> of <m>\hat{p}</m>,
            <me>\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}</me>

        <example>
            <p>Bruce Long and Susan Jordan are candidates for a tightly fought race for a seat in Congress.  You are planning a sample survey to find out how many voters plan to cast their ballot for Ms. Long.  You will contact a simple random sample of likely voters in the 4th Congressional District.  You want to estimate <m>p</m>, the proportion of voters who will cast their ballot for Ms. Long with a 95<percent /> confidence interval.  In a sample of 500 voters, 270 said that they planned to vote for Ms. Long.  Thus, our confidence interval is given by
                <me>\hat{p} \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}} = 0.54 \pm 1.960 \cdot 0.0223 = 0.54 \pm 0.0437.</me></p>

            <title>Sample size for a desired margin of error</title>

            <p>The level <m>C</m> confidence interval for a population proportion <m>p</m> will have a margin of error approximately equal to a specified value <m>m</m> when the sample size is
                <me>n = \left( \frac{z^*}{m} \right)^2 p^*(1- p^*),</me>
            where <m>p^*</m> is the guessed value for the sample proportion.  The margin of error will be less than or equal to <m>m</m> if you guess <m>p^* = 0.5</m>.</p>
