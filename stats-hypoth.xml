	<title>Hypothesis Testing</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>The learning objectives for this chapter are:
            <ul>

                <li>To understand and be able apply tests of significance.</li>

        <title>Testing for Significance</title>

        <p>The statement to be tested is called the <term>null hypothesis</term>.  We design the test to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>

        <p>Assuming the null hypothesis is true, the probability that the observed outcome would take a value as extreme or more extreme than what we actually observe is called the <term><m>P</m>-value</term> of a test.  Small <m>P</m>-values tell us that the evidence against the null hypothesis is strong.</p>

        <title>Inference for a Population Proportion</title>

        <p>Suppose that we have a large population that contains a proportion of <m>p</m> successes, we can estimate <m>p</m> with a sample proportion.  Suppose that we select a simple random sample of size <m>n</m> from the population.  The <term>sample proportion</term> of successes is defined to be
        	<me>\hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of successes in the sample}}{n}.</me>
    	As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is approximately the normal distribution.  The <term>mean</term> of the sampling distribution is <m>p</m> and the standard deviation is 
    		<me>\sqrt{\frac{p(1- p)}{n}}.</me></p>
