	<title>Measuring Central Tendency and Spread</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>The learning objectives for this chapter are:
        	<ul>
        		<li>To understand and be able to analyze data using measures of central tendency<mdash />mean, median, and mode.</li>

        		<li>To understand and be able to analyze data using percentiles and the five-number summary.</li>

        		<li>To understand and be able to analyze data using measures of spread<mdash />range, variance, and standard deviation.  To be able to compute the standard deviation:
        			<ol>

        				<li>Calculate the mean.</li>

        				<li>Calculate the deviation of each data point from the mean.</li>

        				<li>Square each of the deviations.</li>

        				<li>Find the mean of the squares of the deviations.</li>

        				<li>Take the square root to obtain the <term>standard deviation</term>.</li>

        			</ol></li>

        	</ul></p>

        <paragraphs>
        	<title>The Mean <m>\overline{x}</m></title>

        	<p>To find the <term>mean</term> of a set of observations, add their values and divide by the number of observations.  If the <m>n</m>observations are <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>, then their mean is
        		<me>\overline{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}.</me>
			For example, the mean of the data set <m>\{ 3, 4, 6, 7\}</m> is
				<me>\overline{x} = \frac{3 + 4 + 6 + 7}{4} = 5.</me></p>
		</paragraphs>

		<paragraphs>
			<title>The Median <m>M</m></title>

			<p>The <term>median</term> <m>M</m> is the midpoint of a distribution, the number such that half the observations are smaller and the other half are larger.  To find the median:
				<ol>

					<li>Arrange all of the observations in order of size, from smallest to largest.</li>

					<li>If the number of observations <m>n</m> is odd, the median is the center observation in the list.  For example, the median of the data set <m>\{ 3, 4, 6, 7, 10\}</m> is 6.</li>

					<li>If the number of observations <m>n</m> in the list is even, then the median is the average of the to center observations in the list.  For example the median of the data set <m>\{ 3, 4, 6, 7\}</m> is
						<me>\frac{4 + 6}{2} = 5.</me></li>

					</ol></p>

		</paragraphs>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p>A household's <q>net worth</q> is the total value of the household's possessions and investments less the total of its debts.  In 1997, the mean and the median of net worth of American households were <dollar />51,000 and <dollar />212,000.  Which of these numbers is the median and which is the mean?  Explain your reasoning.</p>
			</statement>
		</exercise>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p>Which measure of center, the mean or the median, should you use in each of the following situations?
					<ol>

						<li>Middletown is considering imposing an income tax on its citizens.  The city government wants to know the average income of citizens so that it can estimate the total tax base.</li>

						<li>In a study of the standard of living of typical families in Middletown, a sociologist estimates the average family income in that city.</li>

					</ol></p>

		<paragraphs>
			<title>The Mode</title>

			<p>The <term>mode</term> of a distribution is the most frequently occurring observation.  For example, the mode of the data set <m>\{ 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 9\}</m> is 5.</p>

		</paragraphs>

		<exercise>
        	<statement>
        		<p>Find the mean, median, and mode of the following data sets.
					<ol>

	        			<li><m>\{0, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 100\}</m></li>

	        			<li><m>\{ 0, 50, 100000 \}</m></li>

			<title>Percentiles and the Five-Number Summary</title>

			<p>A <term>percentile</term> is the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20<percent /> of the observations may be found.  The <term>five-number summary</term> consists of the sample minimum (smallest observation) the lower quartile or first quartile (25th percentile), the median, the upper quartile or third quartile (75th percentile), and the sample maximum (largest observation).</p>

        <title>Measuring Spread</title>

        <p>The mean and median do not tell the entire story about a data set.  For example, the data sets <m>\{ 0, 50, 100 \}</m> and <m>\{49, 50, 51\}</m> both have a mean and a median of 50, yet these data sets are vey different.  The first is spread out while the second is much more compact. There are at least two ways of measuring how much a data set is spread out.  The first is the <term>range</term> of data set.  The range is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values.  The range of the first data set is 100, while the range of the second data set is 2.</p>

        <p>It might be the case that range does not adequately describe the spread of a data set.  Consider the two data sets <m>\{ 0, 1, 50, 99, 100 \}</m> and <m>\{0, 49, 50, 51, 100 \}</m>.  Both have a rangle of 100, but data in the first set is concentrated near 0 and 100, while data in the second set is concentrated near the mean of 50.  A better way to quantify the spread is to compute the standard deviation.  Given a data set <m>\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}</m> the <term>standard deviation</term> of this data set is
        	<me>s = \sqrt{ \frac{(x_1 - \overline{x})^2 + (x_2 - \overline{x})^2 + \cdots (x_n - \overline{x})^2}{n}}</me>
        Essentially, we are just averaging the squares of the <term>deviations</term> <m>x_1 - \overline{x}</m> and then taking the square root of this average.  A high standard deviation means that the data is spread out.  A low standard deviation means that the data is centered around the mean.</p>

        <exercise>

				<p>In our definition of standard deviation, we averaged the squares of the deviations.  Wny don't we just average the devitations?</p>

				<p>Jack and Jill are students in two different sections of MTH 128.  Both took exams last week on the data analysis chapter, although the exams were different for the two sections.  In Jack's class, the mean score of all of the exams was 78 with standard deviation 8.  Jill's class did not do quite as well.  The mean score in her class was only 70 with standard deviation 5.  If Jack scored an 90 and Jill scored an 80, who did better on the exam compared to the other students in their respective sections?</p>
