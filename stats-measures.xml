				<p>Jack and Jill are students in two different sections of MTH 128.  Both took exams last week on the data analysis chapter, although the exams were different for the two sections.  In Jack's class, the mean score of all of the exams was 78 with standard deviation 8.  Jill's class did not do quite as well.  The mean score in her class was only 70 with standard deviation 5.  If Jack scored an 90 and Jill scored an 80, who did better on the exam compared to the other students in their respective sections?</p>

				<p>In the <em>2014 Michelin Guide to Pizza Restaurants in Texas</em>, each restaurant has ten of their best selling pizzas rated on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 be a perfect score.  The <em>Michelin Guide</em> publishes the mean and standard deviation of top ten pizzas for each restaurant.  For example, <em>Three Aces Pizza</em> has a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 15.  If your friend asks you for a recommendation, you should select a restaurant with
					<ol>

						<li>a low mean and a low standard deviation.</li>

						<li>a high mean and a low standard deviation.</li>

						<li>a low mean and a high standard deviation.</li>

						<li>a high mean and a high standard deviation.</li>
