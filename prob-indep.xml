			\question
If $A$ is the set of students taking Math 128 at SFA and $B$ is the set of students taking FRE 435 (French Film) at SFA, describe in words what is meant by each of the following.
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{parts}

\part 
$P(A \cup B)$

\part 
$P(A \cap B)$

\part 
$1 - P(B)$

\end{parts}
\end{multicols}

\question
A fair coin is tossed twice.  Tell whether each pair of events below is independent or dependent.
\begin{eqnarray*}
A & = &  \text{heads on the first toss} \\
B & = &  \text{heads on the second toss} \\
C & = & \text{heads on both tosses} \\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{parts}

\part 
$A$ and $B$

\part
$A$ and $C$

\part
$B$ and $C$

\end{parts}

\question 
\begin{parts}

\part 
Your sock drawer contains three red socks and two black socks.  A sock is chosen at random from the drawer and not replaced.  Then a second sock is chosen.  Draw a tree diagram for this experiment and find the probability that you do not choose a matching pair of socks.

\vfill

\part
Suppose that you replace the first sock, and then chose a second sock.  Draw a tree diagram for this experiment, and find the probability that you do not choose a matching pair of socks.

\vfill

\part
What is the probability in (a) and (b) that you chose a matching pair of socks?

\question
An executive committee consisted of 10 members: 4 women and 6 men.  Three members were selected at random to be sent to a meeting in Hawaii.  A blindfolded woman drew 3 names of the 10 names from a hat.  Three women were chosen.  What is the probability of such luck?

\vfill

\question
Three boxes contain a number of black and/or white balls.  
\begin{itemize}

\item
Box 1 contains 4 white balls and 1 black ball.

\item
Box 2 contains 2 white balls and 2 black balls.

\item
Box 3 contains 2 white balls and 0 black balls.

\end{itemize}
Draw a ball from Box 1 and place it in Box 2.  Then draw a ball from Box 2 and place it in Box 3.  Finally, draw a ball from Box 3.  What is the probability that the last ball drawn from Box 3 is white?

\vfill

\question
A drawer has three black socks and two red socks.  A sock is drawn at random and not replaced.  Then a second sock is drawn.  
\begin{parts}

\part
If the first sock was black, what is the probability that the second sock is red?

\vfill

\part
If the first sock was red, what is the probability that the second sock is red?
