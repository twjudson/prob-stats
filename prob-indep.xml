	<title>Conditional Probability and Independent Events</title>

        <introduction>
        <p>The learning objectives for this chapter are:
            <ul>
                <li>To understand the basic ideas of independence.</li>

                <li>To understand and be able to use conditional probability.</li>

                <li>To understand and be able to apply Bayes' Theorem.</li>

		<title>Independent Events</title>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose that I have two coins, a penny and a nickel. If I flip the two coins, what is the probability that the nickel comes up heads?  If I show you that the penny came up heads, does this change the probability of the nickel being heads?</p>
             </statement>
         </exercise>

         <p>This exercise is an example of <term>independent events</term>.  Given two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the events are independent if have knowledge of the outcome of one gives no additional knowledge of the outcome of the other.  If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent events, then
            <me>P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B).</me>
        For three events to be independent, they must be <term>pairwise independent</term>.  That is, for <m>A_1, A_2, A_3</m> to be independent, it must be the case that
            <me>P(A_i \cap A_j) = P(A_i)P(A_j)</me>
        for <m>i \neq j</m>, where <m>i, j = 1, 2, 3</m>.</p>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>A fair coin is tossed twice.

            <statement>
                <p>In recent decades, home pregnancy tests have become quite popular. The tests have become very accurate, but occassionally these tests give wrong results. The test could come back negative while a woman is actually pregnant or postive if a woman is not pregant. Suppose a particular brand of home pregnancy test kits has a rate of 3 per cent of false negatives. That is, there is  probability of 0.03 that a woman could have a negative test and actually be pregnant. Suppose 150 women are tested and all the results come up negative. What is the probability that at least one of the women is actually pregnant?

                <p>Nicole Brown was murdered at her home in Los Angeles on the night of June 12, 1994. The Prime suspect was her husband 0.J.Simpson, at the time a well-known celebrity famous both as a TV actor and as a retired professional football star. This murder led to one of the most heavily publicized murder trial in U.S. during the last century. The fact that the murder suspect had previously physically abused his wife played an important role in the trial. The famous defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, a member of the team of lawyers defending the accused, tried to belittle the relevence of the fact by stating that only 0.1<percent /> of the men who physically abuse their wives actually end up murdering them.  Was the fact that O.J.Simpson had previously physically abused his wife irrelevant to the case?</p>
