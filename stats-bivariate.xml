	<title>Examining Bivariate Data</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>The learning objectives for this chapter are:
            <ul>

                <li>To understand and be able estimate and represent relationships between explanatory variables and a response variable.</li>

                <li>To understand and be able least-squares regression.</li>

                <li>To understand and be able to apply the concept of correlation.</li>

            </ul></p>
    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="section-stats-bivariate">
        <title>Examining Bivariate Data</title>

        <p>This is a section.</p>

       	<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p>Table<nbsp /><xref ref="table-stats-bivariate-phds-cheese" /> gives the number of civil engineering doctorates granted each year in the U.S. and the U.S. per capita consumption of mozzarella cheese (in pounds) for the years 2000 through 2009.
				<ol>

					<li>Make a scatter plot of the data.</li>

					<li>What is the correlation of the two data sets?</li>

					<li>Does correlation imply causation?</li>
