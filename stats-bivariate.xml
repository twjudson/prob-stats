                <li>To understand and be able least-squares regression.</li>

        <title>Scatter Plots</title>

        <p>A <term>scatter plot</term> shows the relationship between two quanitative variable.  The values of one variable are on the horizontal axis, while the values of the second variable are on the vertical axis.  Each data pair is represented by a point determined by the values on each axis.  In a scatter plot, we look for patterns in the data as well as deviations.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-stats-bivariate-cycling">
        	<p>Dr. J. is an avid cyclist.  On a recent trip to Colorado, he recorded the work that he did on the bike (kilo joules), the intensity factor (IF), and the training stress score (TSS) for each ride that he did over a two week period (see Table<nbsp /><xref ref="table-stats-bivariate-cycling" />).  Roughly speaking, the intensity factor is the ratio of power to threshold power.  That is, an intensity factor of 0.600 for a one-hour ride says that you are going at a rate of 60<percent /> of what you are capable of doing for one hour.  The TSS is a number that tells you how hard you worked on that particular ride.  We would like to predict both the IF and TSS from the work done.  The scatter plot of work and TSS is in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-stats-bivariate-cycling" />.</p>

Metabolic rate is the rate at which a body consumes energy.  This rate is important to researchers who study weight gain, exercise, and dieting.  Lean body mass (in kilograms) is the weight of a person without the fat.  If a person weighs 100 kg and is 20<percent /> fat, then their lean body mass is 80 kg.  We measure metabolic rate by the number of calories burned in 24 hours.

        <title>Correlation</title>

        <p>Correlation describes the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.  More specifically, suppose that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are data for <m>n</m> individuals.  That is, we have data sets <m>\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \}</m> and <m>\{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n \}</m>.  Furthermore, suppose that <m>\overline{x}</m> and <m>s_x</m> are the mean and standard deviation for the variable <m>x</m>, while <m>\overline{y}</m> and <m>s_y</m> are the mean and standard deviation for the variable <m>y</m>.  We define the <term>correlation</term> <m>r</m> between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to be
        	<me>r = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{x_i - \overline{x}}{s_x} \right) \left( \frac{y_i - \overline{y}}{s_y} \right).</me>
        Correlation is best computed using a computer or calculator.</p>

        <example>
            <p>The correlation between work and training stress score in Example<nbsp /><xref ref="example-stats-bivariate-cycling" /> is <m>r = 0.9958</m>, indicating a strong linear relationship between the two variables.</p>

        <title>Least-Squares Regression</title>

        <p>A straight line describing how a response variable <m>y</m> changes as an explanatory variable changes is called a <term>regression line</term>. We can use a regression line to make predictions.  The <term>least-squares regression line</term> is the straight line that minimizes the sum of the squares of vertical distances of the data points from the line.  The least-squares regression line is given by the equation
        	<me>\hat{y} = a + bx,</me>
        where the slope <m>b</m> is given by
        	<me>b = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}</me>
