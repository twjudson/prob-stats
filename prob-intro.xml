	<title>Introduction to Probability</title>

    <introduction>

        <p>Although probability has its origins in gambling, the grading of evidence and testimony in medieval law, and estimating risk for maritime insurance premiums, applications of probability have become far more reaching today.  Probability can be used to describe traffic on the Internet, the best course of a medical treatment, the energy states of subatomic particles, and much more.  In addition, a knowledge of probability is essential when we study statistics.  In addition, probability is an active area of mathematical research.</p>

        <p>If we consider a simple random phenomenon, such as rolling a pair of dice or flipping a coin, we do not know what will happen in advance.  However, we can make predictions.  If we flip a fair coin, it will come up heads about half the time.  If we roll a pair of dice, we can expect to roll a 7 a certain precentage of the time.  The description of either one of these to phenomena consists of the following:
        	<ul>
        		<li><p>A list of all possible outcomes.</p></li>

        		<li><p>A probability for each outcome.</p></li>
        	</ul>
       	These two items provide a basis for all probability models.</p>

    </introduction>

        <title>Introduction to Probability</title>

        <p>Tossing a coin or rolling a pair of dice are examples of <term>random processes</term>. In other words, we have no knowledge of how the coin or the pair of dice will land prior to each toss or roll.  The possible <term>outcomes</term> for tossing a coin are heads or tails, and the outcomes for rolling a pair of dice are getting a two through twleve.  We define the <term>probability</term> of an outcome of a random process to be the proportion of times that the outcome would occur if we could do an infinite number of observations.  Thus, the probability of obtaining a heads on any particular toss of a coin is <m>1/2</m>, provided the coin is fair.</p>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Assume that we have a pair of dice and that it is equally likely that a one through six will occur on each die for any particular roll.
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>What is the probability of rolling a 3 if you roll only one die?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of rolling a 3 if you roll a pair of dice?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of rolling a 7 if you roll a pair of dice?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of rolling a 7 if you roll only one die?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of not rolling a 3 if you roll only one die?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of not rolling a 3 if you roll a pair of dice?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of not rolling a 7 if you roll a pair of dice?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of not rolling a 7 if you roll only one die?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of rolling a 3 if you roll a pair of dice and one of the dice is a 1?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of rolling a 3 if you roll a pair of dice and one of the dice is not a 1?</p></li>

                     </ol></p>
             </statement>
         </exercise>

         <p>Usually, we assign numbers between 0 and 1 for probabilites, although we will sometimes using percentages.</p>

         <p>To understand why probability works, we must understand the Law of Large Numbers.  Suppose the we toss a fair coin <m>n</m> times.  We will denote the proportion of heads that occur by <m>\hat{p}_n</m>.  If we toss a coin 100 times and it comes up heads 52 times, then <m>\hat{p}_{100} = 0.52</m>.  The Law of Large Numbers says that <m>\hat{p}_n \to p</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.  Although <m>\hat{p}_n</m> may deviate from <m>p</m> even as <m>n</m> grows large, these deviations become smaller and smaller.  The actual Law of Large Numbers needs to be stated a bit more carefully, and can be proven using advanced calculus, but our discussion here catches the essence.<fn>See <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers" />.</fn></p>

         <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Find several examples of random processes and processes that are not random.  Are there examples of processes that are not random but can be modeled by random processes?</p>

    	<title>Probability Rules</title>


        <p>A <term>sample space</term> is the set of all possible outcomes for a random process.  We will usually denote the sample space by <m>S</m>.  An <term>event</term> is any possible outcome.  For example, we can have the following events for rolling a pair of dice,
            <md>
                <mrow>A \amp = \{ \text{rolling a 7}\}</mrow>
                <mrow>B \amp = \{ \text{rolling an even number}\}</mrow>
                <mrow>C \amp = \{ \text{rolling a 17}\}.</mrow>
            </md>
        We will designate the probability of an event <m>A</m> by <m>P(A)</m>.</p>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Find <m>P(A)</m>, <m>P(B)</m>, and <m>P(C)</m>.</p>
             </statement>
         </exercise>


        <p>We have the following rules that govern probability.
            <ol>
                <li><p>For any event <m>A</m>, <m>0 \leq P(A) \leq 1</m></p></li>

                <li><p><m>P(S) = 1</m></p></li>

                <li><p>For any event <m>A</m>,
                    <me>P(A \text{ does not occur}) = 1 - P(A)</me></p></li>

                <li><p>We say two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>disjoint</term> if <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>.  In this case,
                    <me>P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)</me></p></li>

                </ol>
            We sometimes say that disjoint events are <term>mutually exclusive</term>.</p>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose that you roll a pair of dice.  List at least five pairs of events that are disjoint.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><p>What is the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 if you roll only one die?</p></li>

                        <li><p>What is the probability of rolling a 3 or a 5 if you roll a pair of dice?</p></li>

         </exercise>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose have events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that are not necessarily disjoint. Can you devise a law for determining <m>P(A \text{ or } B)</m>?</p>
             </statement>
             <hint>
             	<p><m>P(A \cup B ) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)</m></p>

         <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>You are playing matchmaker and set up your two friends Alice and Bob on a date.
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>What is the probability that the date will be successful?</p></li>

                        <li><p>Alice calls you right after the date and tells you that she is absolutely enamoured with Bob.  What is the probability that the date was successful?</p></li>

                    </ol></p>
             </statement>
        </exercise>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose that I have two coins, a penny and a nickel. If I flip the two coins, what is the probability that the nickel comes up heads?  If I show you that the penny came up heads, does this change the probability of the nickel being heads?</p>
             </statement>
         </exercise>



         <p>This last exercise is an example of <term>independent events</term>.  Given two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, the events are independent if have knowledge of the outcome of one gives no additional knowledge of the outcome of the other.  If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent events, then
            <me>P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) P(B).</me></p>

        <exercise>

                <p>Suppose that I have two coins, a penny and a nickel. If I flip the two coins, what is the probability that both coins are heads?  If I show you that the penny came up heads, does this change the probability of both coins being heads?</p>
             </statement>
         </exercise>

         <p>This exercise is an example of <term>conditional probability</term>.  Given two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, 
            <me>P(A \text{ given } B) = P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}</me>
        or equivalently
            <me>P(A \text{ and } B)= P(B) P(A|B).</me>
        If event <m>B</m> is known to be true, then we may say something further about the probability of <m>A</m>.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>In recent decades, home pregnancy tests have become quite popular.  The tests have become very accurate, but occassionally these tests give wrong results.  The test could come back negative while a woman is actually pregnant or postive if a woman is not pregant.    Suppose a particular brand of home pregnancy test kits has a rate of 3 per cent of false negatives.  That is, there is  probability of 0.03 that a woman could have a negative test and actually be pregnant.  Suppose 150 women are tested and all the results come up negative.  What is the probability that at least one of the women is actually pregnant?

                		<li><p>What is the probability that all 150 women will accurately test as negative?</p></li>

                		<li><p>What is the probability that there will be at least one of 150 women will have a false negative?</p></li>
