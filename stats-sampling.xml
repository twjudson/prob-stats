        <title>Sampling Distributions</title>


        <p>If we take repeated simple random samples from a population and calculate the mean for each sample, we can ask about the distribution of the all of the sample means.  It turns out that the sample means are normally distributed.  This is true even if the original population is not normally distributed.  We can summarize this with the Central Limit Theorem.</p>

        <theorem>
            <title>Central Limit Theorem</title>

            <statement>
                <p>Draw a simple random sample of size <m>n</m> from any population with mean <m>\mu</m> and finite standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>.  For large values of <m>n</m>, the sampling distribution of sample mean <m>\overline{x}</m> is approximately normal with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma/ \sqrt{n}</m>.</p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>

            <title>Spinning Pennies</title>

            <p>If you toss a penny, most of us would assume that there is a probability of 0.5 that the penny will land on haeds.  If you spin a penny on a flat surface and wait until the penny lands flat, is the probability of getting a heads the same?  For this activity you will need a penny, which your instructor will provide.<fn>This activity can be found in <em>Activity-Based Statistics</em> by R. L. Scheaffer et. al., Spring-Verlag, New York, 1996.</fn></p>

            <p>Place your penny on edge, with Lincoln's profile right side up and facing you.  Flick the edge of the penny with your index finger to get it to spin.  When the penny comes to a rest, record a win if you have a heads and a loss if you have a tails.  If the penny runs into something or falls off your desk, do not count the result.  Repeat this 50 times, recording
                <ol>

                    <li>The number of heads</li>

                    <li>The number of tails</li>

                    <li>Record the sample proportion of heads, <m>\hat{p}</m> for the 50 observations</li>
                </ol>
            Once you have finished, write the value of <m>\hat{p}</m> on the board, then repeat the activity.</p>

        </paragraphs>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>What does the spinning pennies activity tell you about sampling distributions?</p>
            </statement>
        </exercise>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Suppose each person in MATH S<ndash />304 conducts an opinion poll.  The poll will consist of asking 50 randomly chosen voters if think the process for choosing a Presidential nominee is fair.  If each person reports a sample proportion, what would a graph of the proportions look like?</p>

        </exercise>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Pennies and the Central Limit Theorem</title>

            <p>If you have a collection of pennies, some will be older and some will be newer.  It is a reasonable assumption that there are fewer old pennies in circulation than new pennies.  In fact, if we made a graph of the distribution of all pennies, you might expect that the graph would not be symmetric.<fn>This activity can be found in <em>Activity-Based Statistics</em> by R. L. Scheaffer et. al., Spring-Verlag, New York, 1996.</fn></p>

            <p>For this activity you will need to collect a random sample of 25 pennies<mdash />you should be able to get a roll of 50 pennies from the bank.  Just make sure that you do not get a roll of freshly minted pennies.</p>
               

        </paragraphs>

        <exercise>
            <statement>
                 <p><ol>

                    <li>Make a list of the dates of the 25 pennies.</li>

                    <li>Next to each date, write the age of the penny.</li>

                    <li>Report the ages of your pennies on the board, so that we can make a class histogram.</li>

                    <li>What is the mean and standard deviation of our population of pennies?</li>

                    <li>Are the ages of the pennies normally distributed?</li>

                    <li>Compute the mean and standard deviation of a random sample of <m>n = 5</m> of your pennies.  Report your results so that we can make a class histogram.</li>

                    <li>Compute the mean and standard deviation of a random sample of <m>n = 10</m> of your pennies.  Report your results so that we can make a class histogram.</li>

                    <li>Compute the mean and standard deviation of a random sample of <m>n = 25</m> of your pennies.  Report your results so that we can make a class histogram.</li>

                    <li>Examine the four histograms created by the class.  What can you say about the distribution, center, and spread of the histogram as <m>n</m> increases.</li>

                </ol></p>
            </statement>
        </exercise>

        <p>It takes a bit of work to prove the following result, but the sample proportions are approximately nomally distributed for large <m>n</m>.</p>

        <theorem>
            <title>Sampling Distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m></title>
            <statement>
                <p>Given both <m>np \gt 10</m> and <m>n(1-p) \gt 10</m>, the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is approximately normally distributed with a mean of <m>\mu p</m> and standard deviation <m>\sqrt{p(1- p)/n}</m>.</p>
            </statement>

        <title>Technology</title>

        <p>Many different types of technology can be used for the teaching and learning of statisitics<mdash />handheld calculators, smart phones and tablet apps, spreadsheets, and dedicated statistics software. These days, the default calculator is probably made by Texas Instruments.  TI calculators can certainly do all the necessary statistical computations for any middle or high school statistics course, provided the data set is not too big.  There are plenty of apps for statistical calculation available for smart phones and tablet, many of which are free.  You can use Google to find them.  Spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel and Apple Numbers, have some limited statistical capability, but spreadsheets were not designed to do statistics.  Just try doing a box plot in Excel.</p>
